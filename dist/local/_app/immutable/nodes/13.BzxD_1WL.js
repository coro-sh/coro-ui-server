**Last Updated:** 22 January 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Coro ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our service.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information

- Name
- Authentication credentials

### Usage Information

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide and maintain the service
- Authenticate users
- Improve service functionality
- Communicate with users about the service
- Detect and prevent security issues

## Data Storage and Security

- All sensitive information (passwords, authentication credentials, JWTs) is encrypted at rest and in transit
- All data transmission uses secure protocols (HTTPS/TLS)
- Passwords are managed and encrypted by our authentication provider (Logto)
- Application and database infrastructure is hosted on Fly.io with industry-standard security controls

- However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure

## Beta Period Considerations

During the beta period:

- Data retention policies may change
- We may need to reset or migrate data
- Additional data may be collected for testing purposes

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information for advertising or marketing purposes.

Your data is shared only with essential infrastructure and service providers necessary to operate Coro:

- **Logto** - Authentication and identity management (processes login credentials)
- **Fly.io** - Application and database hosting (stores application data)
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Web application delivery (serves the user interface)

These providers are bound by their own privacy policies and security commitments. We do not share your information with any other third parties except:

- When required by law or legal process
- To protect our rights, safety, or the safety of others

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Request deletion of your data
